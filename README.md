# bright-coffee-analysis

This repository contains the full analysis of transactional data from Bright Coffee Shops located across New York City. The goal of this project was to understand customer purchasing behaviour, peak sales periods, product performance, and store-level insights in order to support operational and business decision-making.

The dataset provided included a record of every transaction processed in January—covering transaction dates, times, quantities, item prices, store locations, product categories, and detailed product descriptions. This enabled a complete end-to-end breakdown of sales patterns at both a product and store level.

Project Background

As part of a real-world analytical simulation, Bright Coffee aims to enhance customer experience, optimize stock planning, and increase revenue through data-driven insights. The analysis conducted in this project helps the business understand:

When customers buy most frequently

Which products generate the highest revenue

Which store locations outperform others

How different product categories behave throughout the day

This README outlines the full analytical process, findings, and recommendations.

The project followed a structured analysis approach:

Data Import and Preparation

Loaded the CSV dataset into Excel and Snowflake

Cleaned inconsistencies in date/time formats and product names

Created computed fields such as total revenue per transaction

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identified hourly, categorical, and store-level patterns

Evaluated product demand and price behaviour

Visualization & Insights

Built dashboards using Excel

Highlighted trends for internal report creation

Planning & Documentation

Used Figma (FigJam) to map the project workflow

Used Miro to visually structure tasks and dataset meaning

Key Findings

Morning hours between 7 AM and 10 AM show consistently high sales volume driven by commuters.

Coffee-based beverages remain the primary revenue contributor across all stores.

Lower Manhattan emerges as the top-performing location, influenced by high customer traffic.

Bakery items significantly support upselling, with many customers purchasing these items alongside beverages.

Introduce morning promotional bundles (e.g., Coffee + Pastry).

Increase inventory for top-performing products in high-traffic stores.

Encourage afternoon promotions to improve off-peak performance.

Strengthen product placement for bakery goods to maximize upsell opportunities.
